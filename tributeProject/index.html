              <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
              <p>The polling for the presidential 
                election began on 15 July 2002, in 
                Parliament and the state assemblies,
                 with the media claiming that the election
                  was a one-sided affair and Kalam's victory 
                  was a foregone conclusion; the count was held 
                  on 18 July.[47] Kalam became the 11th president of
                   the Republic of India in an easy victory,[48] and 
                   moved into the Rashtrapati Bhavan after he was sworn in 
                   on 25 July.[49] Kalam was the third President of India to
                    have been honoured with a Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour,
                     before becoming the President Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (1954) and Zakir
                      Husain (1963) were the earlier recipients of Bharat Ratna who later became 
                      the President of India.[50] He was also the first scientist and the first bachelor
                       to occupy Rashtrapati Bhawan.[51]</p>
